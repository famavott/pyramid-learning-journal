Having a day to get Sublime Text configured before any \"real\" assignments was appreciated, especially since it is new to many of us. We also briefly covered how to set-up virtual environments, which conceptually makes sense to me in terms of keeping packages associated with specific programs isolated from other environments. That said, it seems like a pain to continually have to reinstall packages, and it seems like a lot to keep track of. While python's syntax feels beginner friendly for now, the set-up is not as forgiving. \r\n\r\nI'm equally nervous and excited to get into the material for the rest of the week, and I expect to be knee deep in work by the weekend.",

I was lucky to have a partner that wanted to go through things very deliberately, which was great because we used a new method of pair programming. Once we figured out the basic workflow, we switched roles regularly, and got through the whole thing. Thinking about writing tests before writing feature code is going to be a big adjustment (and tedious), but I get the importance in writing stuff that actually works as intended. \r\n\r\nI also signed up for a lightning talk, although I haven't decided what to talk about yet, and did some additional reading. I need to do some more reading about args and kwargs because I don't think I was following that portion of the lecture. Tomorrow will be a good day to do reading on topics I'm not super comfortable with thus far.",

Our paired assignment took a lot of time to get on a roll, but we eventually got to the point where I think we've meet the specifications laid out in the instructions. It felt like the first two hours were a drag, and it was demotivating to realize that we had written less than 15 lines of code at that point. We just kept working at it, and it felt like when one person was really hitting a wall, the other was able to make a contribution that led to progress. \r\n\r\nWe covered a lot of methods, and other basics of the syntax for a long time during lecture today, then breezed through the second part of class. I don't feel like I comprehended a lot of the introduction to python packaging, so I will need to go back through the video and notes this weekend to make sense of it. I'm sure it will be clear after just a few days of repetition.",

We covered Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) today, and I wrote all of that out because I could see myself using the acronym and not remembering what it actually stands for. The information is dense, no doubt about it, but I know it's important to get a good understanding of how these processes work. \r\n\r\nThe socket exercise wasn't too bad, although I felt like I was copying a lot from the class notes, and there's no way I could do that stuff from memory. After working on that, I immediately transitioned to implementing a single-linked list with my other partner. He had a lot of the logic down, and was really helpful in getting me to understand exactly what we were trying to achieve with the exercise. One thing I do wish we covered in class is why a single-linked list is important, and not just because it is a common interview question. I tend to be someone that likes context, and I don't think we talked much about it's importance. Overall, today was a positive start to the week.",

There were some good insights from other classmates that my partner and I carried over to our code. We had very few tests, and class today allows us to quickly implement effective tests. This exercise is certainly making me appreciate the built-in functionality that is abstracted away from us with programming languages. \r\n\r\nWe briefly covered inheritance and composition today, using composition to build out our stack. After waiting too long to get a few simple questions answers, we finally got our sub-class to inherit the methods we wanted. It's easy to see how that whole process can be horrible to debug if you're dealing with classes that have multiple levels of inheritance. \r\n\r\nThe server exercise is less interesting to me at the moment, but I think we're still in the crawl phase, and I'm looking forward to more practical applications.",
