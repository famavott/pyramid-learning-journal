                We dove into our first framework today, which feels like a big step into the "real" stuff. I think everyone is overwhelmed with the setup for Pyramid because of all the steps involved, as well as the number of directories that are made for you when using cookiecutter. As great as it is, it's new, there's a lot going on that we haven't been exposed to yet, and we went through everything quickly. For example, why do I have a learning journal repo, with a learning journal directory, with a learning journal directory? The good news is that Pyramid and cookiecutter are doing a lot of work for us, and I'm sure we'll feel much better about it by the end of the week. It will be cool to see more of the fruits of our labor this week compared to last.
